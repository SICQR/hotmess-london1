# HOTMESS HOOK-UP QRS — IN-CLUB AMBASSADOR KIT

**Everything on-site ambassadors need to promote and support Hook-Up QRs**

---

## ROLE: IN-CLUB AMBASSADOR

### Who You Are
- HOTMESS community member (PRO or ELITE)
- On-site at partner venues during events
- Face of the Hook-Up QR system in physical spaces
- First point of contact for men with questions

### What You Do
- Encourage QR scans (without being pushy)
- Answer questions about the system
- De-escalate confusion or concern
- Report issues to hosts or venue staff
- Maintain consent-first vibe on the floor

### What You're Not
- Not a bouncer (don't enforce venue rules)
- Not a moderator (hosts handle Telegram rooms)
- Not a therapist (direct care needs to CareBot)

---

## OPENING SCRIPT (When You Arrive)

**Say to men you encounter:**
```
"Hey man — tonight we're running HOTMESS Hook-Up Zones.

See a QR on each floor?
Scan one → you join the guys in that area.

Men-only, 18+, consent-first.
Super chill."
```

**Tone:** Casual. Grounded. Not salesy.

---

## AMBASSADOR TOOLS (What You Carry)

### 1) Wristband with Personal 1:1 QR
- Wear a HOTMESS wristband with YOUR 1:1 QR on it
- If someone asks "what's this?" → they can scan and connect with you
- Shows the system in action

### 2) Stack of Mini QR Stickers
- Small vinyl stickers (2" round)
- Hand them out to interested men
- They can stick on phone cases, notebooks, etc.

### 3) Clipboard with Floor-Specific QR Posters
- One poster per floor/zone
- Show people where QRs are located
- Backup in case a poster falls down

### 4) Host Telegram Backchannel
- Group chat with hosts and other ambassadors
- Use to report issues or ask for backup
- Quick coordination during events

### 5) Moderation Shortcuts
- You have limited mod powers:
  - `/mute` (for obvious spam)
  - `/warn` (for borderline behavior)
  - `/care` (summon care resources)
- Use sparingly — hosts handle most moderation

### 6) Safety Escalation Cue
- If something feels dangerous or off:
  - Alert venue staff immediately
  - Report in ambassador backchannel
  - Direct involved parties to care resources

**Phrase:** "If anything off, send them to Aftercare or a host."

### Placement Tips:

## COMMON QUESTIONS (FAQ)

### Q: "What's this QR for?"

**A:**
```
"It's a HOTMESS Hook-Up QR.
Scan it → join the room for this floor.
See who's here, connect, chat.
Men-only, 18+, totally moderated."
```

---

### Q: "Is this safe?"

**A:**
```
"Yeah. Every QR has consent checks built in.
Rooms are moderated by HOTMESS hosts.
If anything goes wrong, you can /report or use /care.
Safer than random approaches on the floor."
```

---

### Q: "Do I have to pay?"

**A:**
```
"Nope. Scanning is free.
If you want your own personal QR later, that's PRO membership (£15/mo).
But joining rooms is free for everyone."
```

---

### Q: "What if someone's creepy?"

**A:**
```
"Use /report in the room.
Hosts will handle it immediately.
We don't tolerate harassment."
```

---

### Q: "Can I create my own QR?"

**A:**
```
"Yeah. If you have PRO or ELITE membership, you can make a personal QR.
Stick it on your phone case, profile, whatever.
Guys scan it → you get a DM."
```

---

### Q: "Is my identity shared?"

**A:**
```
"Only your Telegram handle shows in the room.
No real names, no photos unless you choose to share.
It's as private as you want it to be."
```

---

### Q: "What happens after I scan?"

**A:**
```
"You see a quick consent check.
Then you join the Telegram room for this floor.
Chat, connect, DM people if you want.
Leave anytime."
```

---

### Q: "Do I need to download anything?"

**A:**
```
"Just Telegram if you don't have it already.
It's free, secure, and private.
Most guys already have it."
```

---

### Q: "Can straight people use this?"

**A:**
```
"Nope. HOTMESS is men-only, queer space.
This is for us."
```

---

### Q: "What if I'm not out?"

**A:**
```
"Totally fine. Rooms are private and moderated.
No outing, no screenshots without consent.
Your privacy is protected."
```

---

## ENCOURAGING SCANS (Without Being Pushy)

### ✅ DO SAY:

```
"Have you scanned the QR for this floor yet?"
→ Casual, informative

"There's a HOTMESS QR by the bar if you want to see who's here tonight."
→ Helpful, specific location

"The basement room is live right now — scan the QR downstairs if you're curious."
→ Creating FOMO (in a good way)
```

### ❌ DON'T SAY:

```
"You HAVE to scan this QR!"
→ Too pushy

"Everyone's doing it, why aren't you?"
→ Peer pressure, cringe

"This will change your life!"
→ Overselling, inauthentic
```

---

## DE-ESCALATION (On the Floor)

### Scenario: Someone's confused or skeptical

**Response:**
```
"I get it. It's new.
Basically, it's just a way to connect with guys who are actually here tonight.
No pressure. Check it out if you want."
```

**Then:** Walk away. Don't hover.

---

### Scenario: Someone's concerned about privacy

**Response:**
```
"Fair question.
Your real name isn't shared. Only your Telegram handle.
Rooms are moderated, no screenshots allowed.
If you're still not comfortable, totally cool to skip it."
```

---

### Scenario: Someone's drunk/overwhelmed

**Response:**
```
"Hey man, maybe sit this one out for now.
Grab some water, chill for a bit.
If you need care, there's a bot for that: /care"
```

**If they're really struggling:**
→ Direct to venue staff or care team.

---

### Scenario: Someone's aggressive about not wanting to participate

**Response:**
```
"All good, man. No pressure.
Have a good night."
```

**Then:** Disengage. Don't argue.

"Hey man, you okay?
If you need support, there's CareBot: /care
Or I can get venue staff if you want."
