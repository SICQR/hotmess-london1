# HOTMESS Component Library Documentation

## Design System Overview

This is the complete UX writing system for HOTMESS LONDON. Every component, every state, every piece of microcopy — documented, tokenized, and ready for production.

---

## Global Principles

### Voice & Tone
- **Masc, hot, present** — bold, sweaty, immediate
- **Care-vein** — grounding, calm when needed
- **Wink-kink** — heat with humour, never cruel
- **Brotherhood** — men holding men, zero judgement

### Sentence Structure
- Short, punchy, rhythmic
- Bold verbs: enter, scan, move, hold, tune, breathe
- Soft when care is needed
- No exclamation marks (unless ironic)

### Word Bank (Approved)
heat • pulse • held • loud • scan • sweat • rite • roam • drop • unlock • streak • surge • zone • flare • hum • tether • night body

// Usage
<button>{BUTTONS.primary.scanBeacon}</button>
toast.success(NOTIFICATIONS.success.rewardUnlocked);

built for the men who survived enough to want more.
```

## Notes for Developers

1. **Never hardcode copy.** Always use tokens.
2. **States matter.** Every component has default, loading, error, and empty states.
3. **Accessibility first.** ARIA labels and alt text are mandatory.
4. **Tone consistency.** Run new copy through the voice filter: masc, sweaty, care-first.
5. **Legal is sacred.** Don't modify legal copy without approval.

---

## Notes for Designers

1. **Figma tokens** map directly to code tokens.
2. **Copy is part of the design.** Don't lorem ipsum. Use real tokens.
3. **Mobile-first.** Nightlife lives in pockets.
4. **High contrast.** Red/pink neon on black. Readable in low light.
5. **Care layers** always visible, never preachy.

End of documentation. Stay loud. Stay held.
