# HOTMESS HOOK-UP ROOM HOST SCRIPTS

**Complete operational guide for hosts managing hookup zones**

---

## ROLE: HOOK-UP ROOM HOST

### Purpose
Maintain a safe, masculine, permissive vibe in hookup zones while preventing abuse and supporting men who need care.

### Core Principles
1. **Consent is ongoing** — it can be withdrawn anytime
2. **Masculine not toxic** — keep energy grounded, not aggressive
3. **Permissive not chaotic** — open space with clear boundaries
4. **Care-first** — if someone's struggling, prioritize their safety

---

## DAILY RITUALS

### 1) ROOM OPENING (Automatic or Manual)

**Pinned Message (Auto-Posted):**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Men-only. 18+. Consent-first.

VIBES ARE LIVE. KEEP IT SMOOTH:
✓ Respect boundaries

### 2) WELCOME SCRIPT (Every New Join)

**When someone joins, post:**
```
Welcome @username.

Take your time, keep it real, speak respectfully.
If you're not feeling it, it's cool to say so.

Enjoy the vibe. 🖤
```

**Tone:** Warm but not overly friendly. Grounded. Masculine.

**Every hour, post ONE of these (rotate):**

**Option 1 (Consent):**

Everyone breathe.
Consent is ongoing.
You can change your mind anytime.

If anything feels off, step back.
No pressure. No shame.
/care if you need support.
```

**Option 3 (Respect):**
```
Remember — respect keeps this room open.
Be clear. Be kind. Be direct.
```

You're not alone.
```

Alright, let's cool down.

@user1 @user2 — take this to DMs or drop it.
This room is for everyone, not just you two.

Move on.

@user1 @user2 — both of you, 10 min timeout.
When you come back, keep it chill.
```
