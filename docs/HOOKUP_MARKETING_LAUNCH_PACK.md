## 3) PRESS ANGLE

### Press Release Headline

**HOTMESS Launches World's First QR-Powered Hook-Up Layer for Nightlife**

### Press Release Body

```
London, December 2024 — HOTMESS LONDON, the masculine nightlife OS 
for queer men 18+, today announced the launch of Hook-Up QRs, a new 
system that lets men connect in real spaces without apps, profiles, 
or public exposure.

Hook-Up QRs work in two modes:

ROOM-BASED: QR codes posted in clubs, saunas, and party zones let 
men join live Telegram rooms for those specific areas. A QR on a 
basement wall labeled "MEN ON THIS FLOOR TONIGHT" connects everyone 
in that space.

1-ON-1: Personal QR codes on phone cases, profiles, or stickers 
enable direct, private connections via HOTMESS's moderation system.

Every hookup beacon includes:
• Mandatory consent check-ins
• Built-in care resources
• Rate limiting to prevent spam
• Enhanced moderation
• Clear safety messaging

"Queer men have always connected in physical spaces," says Phil 
[Founder], "but those connections have been chaotic, unsafe, or 
stigmatized. Hook-Up QRs bring structure, consent, and care to 
real-world hookup culture."

The system is live now for all HOTMESS members across London.

FREE members can join 2 room-based zones per night.
PRO members (£15/mo) can create personal 1:1 QRs.
ELITE members (£35/mo) get advanced controls including time-bound 
and geo-locked beacons.

Hook-Up QRs integrate with HOTMESS's existing XP system, awarding 
points for safe, consensual connections.

Club partners can request hookup zones for their venues at no cost.

### Media Quotes

**Phil (Founder):**
> "This isn't Grindr. This is connection in the real world, with 
> consent and care baked in from the start."

**Sample User (Anonymous):**
> "I scanned a QR in a club basement and actually talked to guys 
> who were right there with me. It felt real, not like swiping."

**Club Partner:**
> "Our men stay longer, spend more, and feel safer. Hook-Up QRs 
> are a win for everyone."
